## Challenge Description
```
Welcome to your first day at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital! The team found a new case; a weird patient that goes by 'melodyyman'. Music seems to be his only personality trait. House starts an office pool on how long it will take you to quit, so you go all out and bet him you'll diagnose the patient House-style, without talking to the patient once. This is your time to shine. How good a patient history can you collect? Can you find enough symptoms to diagnose him?
