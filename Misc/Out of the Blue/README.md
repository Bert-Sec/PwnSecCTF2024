## Challenge Description
```
While searching for a new way to encode hidden messages, an idea struck meâ€”completely out of the blue.
Now, before you lies a puzzle, concealed within a sea of blue hues, each one unlike the other. 
In this enigmatic world, light whispers its secrets, while darkness cloaks the truth.
Hidden deep within this mysterious pattern is a treasure, waiting to be uncovered.
The path to the treasure is woven into the differences. 
Can you decipher the clues, extract the flag, and unlock the secret buried in the blues?
